      I am a B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering. I have recently completed my second semester, during which I gained a solid foundation in programming. So far, I have learned Python and C++, which has helped me understand core programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. I look forward to exploring more advanced topics and expanding my skills in the upcoming semesters.
