      As part of my learning experience in the field of Computer Science and Engineering, I have actively engaged in project-based learning to enhance my practical skills. After gaining a foundational understanding of Python and C++, I began working on small-scale projects that allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios. These projects included developing basic applications such as a calculator, a to-do list manager, and simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe. Through these hands-on activities, I improved my logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of how different components of a program interact. Additionally, I learned the importance of clean code, debugging, and testing. These experiences not only strengthened my technical knowledge but also boosted my confidence in building software independently. I am now motivated to take on more advanced projects involving data structures, algorithms, and eventually web development and machine learning to further expand my skills and contribute meaningfully to the tech field.
